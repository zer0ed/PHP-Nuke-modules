1. Introduction and Requirements
--------------------------------
This themepak is designed to work with both php-nuke 5.5 and phpBB 2 forums (phpBB to
nuke port).  The style sheets (css) are combined into one file and therefore work as
one overall site theme. You don't need to use the included phpBB template. All themes
are created from scratch by me (except ExtraLite which was modified by me). All themes
support the RouterScript 1.7 module (also coded by me).


2. Installation
---------------
Extract archive to temp dir and copy included as noted below(and chmod if shown):

3. Use
------
* If you want to use the phpBB template then upload it and add it in the forums admin.
* To use the php-nuke themes just upload them.
* If you want a status bar clock (Javascript) then see the header.htm file for the code
and add it too the header & footer templates in each theme.
